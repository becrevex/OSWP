Got it ‚Äî the error you're seeing ("**an error occurred during signature verification**") usually happens when trying to install or update packages via APT, and it means **your system can‚Äôt verify the authenticity of the package source**. Here‚Äôs how to fix it and get you back on track installing FreeRADIUS-WPE.

## ‚úÖ Fixing the Signature Verification Error in Kali

### üîÅ Step 1: Update GPG Keys

```bash
sudo apt update --allow-unauthenticated
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 0xYOURKEYID
```

If you don‚Äôt know the key ID, try refreshing all keys:

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys --keyserver-options timeout=10 --recv-keys 0xED444FF07D8D0BF6
```

> You can also try `keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com` if `hkp://` doesn‚Äôt work.

### üßΩ Step 2: Clean Local Caches

```bash
sudo apt clean
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
sudo apt update
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Step 3: Temporarily Bypass Signature Check (Not Recommended Long-Term)

If the keyserver is down or the key is missing, and you're stuck:

```bash
sudo apt update --allow-unauthenticated
sudo apt install freeradius --allow-unauthenticated
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Use only as a last resort, and **never on production machines**.

---

### üöÄ Alternative: Build FreeRADIUS-WPE from Source (Recommended)

If you're hitting this error while installing from APT, and you're going to compile from source anyway, skip the `apt install freeradius` step and proceed with the **Git clone + build method** I gave earlier:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server.git
cd freeradius-server
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

This version **doesn‚Äôt rely on signed apt packages**, so the verification error won‚Äôt block it.

Would you like me to provide a script that automates the full install + config for FreeRADIUS-WPE and prepares your rogue AP setup for PEAP/MSCHAPv2 attacks?
